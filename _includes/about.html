                    <h3 class="section-subheading-about">Hello! My name is Philip. Thank you for checking out my GitHub.io page! I am currently studying Computer Science (Games Specialization) at <a href="http://www.concordia.ca/" target="_blank">Concordia University</a> in Montreal, Canada.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                    I have completed a DEP in Computer Science Technology at <a href="http://www.vaniercollege.qc.ca/" target="_blank">Vanier College</a> which allowed me to explore the diversity of the field. 
                        <br />
                        <br />
                    This solidified my passion for the industry and made me realize that Game Programming as well as Software Development are my true passions.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                    No matter the challenge, I rise up to the task and tackle it with excitment and (sometimes maybe too much) drive.
                        <br />
                        <br />
